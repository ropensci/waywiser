#' Find the area of applicability
#'
#' This function calculates the "area of applicability" of a model, as
#' introduced by Meyer and Pebesma (2021). While the initial paper introducing
#' this method focused on spatial models, there is nothing inherently spatial
#' about the method; it can be used with any type of data.
#'
#' Predictions made on points "inside" the area of applicability should be as
#' accurate as predictions made on the data provided to `testing`.
#' That means that generally `testing` should be your final hold-out
#' set so that predictions on points inside the area of applicability are
#' accurately described by your reported model metrics.
#' When passing an `rset` object to `x`, predictions made on points "inside" the
#' area of applicability instead should be as accurate as predictions made on
#' the assessment sets during cross-validation.
#'
#' @section Differences from CAST:
#' This implementation differs from
#' Meyer and Pebesma (2021) (and therefore from CAST) when using cross-validated
#' data in order to minimize data leakage. Namely, in order to calculate
#' the dissimilarity index \eqn{DI_{k}}, CAST:
#'
#' 1. Rescales all data used for cross validation at once, lumping assessment
#'    folds in with analysis data.
#' 2. Calculates a single \eqn{\bar{d}} as the mean distance between all points
#'    in the rescaled data set, including between points in the same assessment
#'    fold.
#' 3. For each point \eqn{k} that's used in an assessment fold, calculates
#'    \eqn{d_{k}} as the minimum distance between \eqn{k} and any point in its
#'    corresponding analysis fold.
#' 4. Calculates \eqn{DI_{k}} by dividing \eqn{d_{k}} by \eqn{\bar{d}} (which
#'    was partially calculated as the distance between \eqn{k} and the rest of
#'    the rescaled data).
#'
#' Because assessment data is used to calculate constants for rescaling analysis
#' data and \eqn{\bar{d}}, the assessment data may appear too "similar" to
#' the analysis data when calculating \eqn{DI_{k}}. As such, waywiser treats
#' each fold in an `rset` independently:
#'
#' 1. Each analysis set is rescaled independently.
#' 2. Separate \eqn{\bar{d}} are calculated for each fold, as the mean distance
#'    between all points in the analysis set for that fold.
#' 3. Identically to CAST, \eqn{d_{k}} is the minimum distance between a point
#'    \eqn{k} in the assessment fold and any point in the
#'    corresponding analysis fold.
#' 4. \eqn{DI_{k}} is then found by dividing \eqn{d_{k}} by \eqn{\bar{d}},
#'    which was calculated independently from {k}.
#'
#' Predictions are made using the full training data set, rescaled once (in
#' the same way as CAST), and the mean \eqn{\bar{d}} across folds, under the
#' assumption that the "final" model in use will be retrained using the entire
#' data set.
#'
#' In practice, this means waywiser produces very slightly higher \eqn{\bar{d}}
#' values than CAST and a slightly higher area of applicability threshold than
#' CAST when using `rset` objects.
#'
#' @param x Either a data frame, matrix, formula
#' (specifying predictor terms on the right-hand side), recipe
#' (from [recipes::recipe()], or `rset` object, produced by resampling functions
#' from rsample or spatialsample.
#'
#' If `x` is a recipe, it should be the same one used to pre-process the data
#' used in your model. If the recipe used to build the area of applicability
#' doesn't match the one used to build the model, the returned area of
#' applicability won't be correct.
#'
#' @param y Optional: a recipe (from [recipes::recipe()]) or formula.
#'
#' If `y` is a recipe, it should be the same one used to pre-process the data
#' used in your model. If the recipe used to build the area of applicability
#' doesn't match the one used to build the model, the returned area of
#' applicability won't be correct.
#'
#' @param data The data frame representing your "training" data, when using the
#'  formula or recipe methods.
#'
#' @param testing A data frame or matrix containing the data used to
#'  validate your model. This should be the same data as used to calculate all
#'  model accuracy metrics.
#'
#'  If this argument is `NULL`, then this function will use the training data
#'  (from `x` or `data`) to calculate within-sample distances.
#'  This may result in the area of applicability threshold being set too high,
#'  with the result that too many points are classed as "inside" the area of
#'  applicability.
#'
#' @param importance Either:
#'
#'   * A data.frame with two columns: `term`, containing the names of each
#'     variable in the training and testing data, and `estimate`, containing
#'     the (raw or scaled) feature importance for each variable.
#'   * An object of class `vi` with at least two columns, `Variable` and `Importance`.
#'
#' All variables in the training data (`x` or `data`, depending on the context)
#' must have a matching importance estimate, and all terms with importance
#' estimates must be in the training data.
#'
#' @param ... Not currently used.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' This method assumes your model was fit using dummy variables in the place of
#' any non-numeric predictor, and that you have one importance score per
#' dummy variable. Having non-numeric predictors will cause this function to
#' fail.
#'
#' @return
#'
#' A `ww_area_of_applicability` object, which can be used with [predict()]
#' to calculate the distance of new data to the original training data, and
#' determine if new data is within a model's area of applicability.
