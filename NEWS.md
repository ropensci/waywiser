# waywiser (development version)

* `ww_multi_scale()` now warns if you provide `crs` as an argument to `sf::st_make_grid()` via `...`. Grids created by this function will always take their CRS from `data`.

* `ww_multi_scale()` now throws an error if you pass arguments via `...` while also providing a list of grids (because those arguments would be ignored).

* `ww_multi_scale()` is now faster when `data` is an sf object, particularly when grids are created by passing arguments to `sf::st_make_grid()` (rather than passing grids via `grids`).

# waywiser 0.5.0

* `ww_multi_scale()` did not correctly handle grid cellsizes with units. Units (set using the `units` package) are now respected.

* `ww_multi_scale()` using sf data always returned "1" for truth and estimate counts. This was because counts were calculated post-aggregation by mistake. Calculation order has been fixed, and these counts should now be correct.

# waywiser 0.4.2

* This is a patch release to keep up with additional breaking changes in the vip package. There are no user-facing differences in this version.

# waywiser 0.4.1

* This is a patch release to keep up with breaking changes in the vip package. There are no user-facing differences in this version.

# waywiser 0.4.0

## Breaking Changes

* `ww_build_neighbors()` (and by extent, every spatial dependence metric) will
  no longer calculate neighbors for non-point or non-polygon geometries.
  
* Functions dealing with local Moran's I and related p-values (both data frame 
  and vector variants) now return unnamed vectors. 

## New Features

* Added a new method to support passing a `SpatRaster` to `data` in 
  `ww_multi_scale()`, with `truth` and `estimate` being indices used to subset 
  `data`. This is a bit faster than passing `SpatRaster` objects to `truth` and
  `estimate`, as extraction is only done once per grid rather than twice, but 
  does not easily support passing R functions to `aggregation_function`.
  
* Metric functions now have better error messages including the name of the 
  function the _user_ called that errored, not the internal function that 
  errored. Huge thanks to @EmilHvitfeldt for their PR (#40).

* Data frame metric functions now guarantee that `.estimate` will be an unnamed
  vector.

## Bug Fixes

* The `sf` method for `ww_multi_scale()` is now _much_ faster (and more memory 
  efficient). 
  
* Fixed the warning when `ww_area_of_applicability()` calculates an AOA 
  threshold of 0. It now includes "Did you accidentally pass the same data as 
  testing and training?" as a bullet.

# waywiser 0.3.0

## Breaking Changes

* Removed combination functions -- `ww_global_geary`, `ww_global_moran`, 
  `ww_local_geary`, `ww_local_moran`, `ww_local_getis_ord`. Use `metric_set()`
  to combine functions instead.

* Renamed `ww_local_getis_ord_pvalue_vec()` and variants to 
  `ww_local_getis_ord_g_pvalue_vec()`; this change allows internal functions to
  work properly, and makes it easier for the output to indicate if the p-value
  is associated with a g or g* value.

* Yardstick metrics will no longer include geometry columns in their returns.

* The `na_action` argument to `ww_area_of_applicability()` has been replaced by
  `na_rm`, with a default value of `FALSE`. 
  
* `na_rm` is now `TRUE` by default for non-spatial-autocorrelation functions.
  NA values will cause spatial-autocorrelation functions to fail with an error.

## New Features

* Added functions (primarily `ww_multi_scale()`) and a vignette for multi-scale 
  assessment of model predictions.

* Added functions to calculate metrics from Ji and Gallo (2006) and Willmott
  (1981, 1982, 2012): `ww_agreement_coefficient()`, 
  `ww_systematic_agreement_coefficient()`, 
  `ww_unsystematic_agreement_coefficient()`, `ww_unsystematic_mpd(),`,
  `ww_systematic_mpd()`, `ww_unsystematic_rmpd()`, `ww_systematic_rmpd()`,
  `ww_willmott_d()`, `ww_willmott_dr()`, `ww_willmott_d1()`, 
  `ww_systematic_mse()`, `ww_unsystematic_mse()`, `ww_systematic_rmse()`,
  `ww_unsystematic_rmse()`. Note that `ww_willmott_dr()` uses the version
  from Willmott (2012); other implementations (sometimes called "d1r") seem to 
  use an unbounded variant that I haven't found a reference to support.

* Changed a call in `ww_area_of_applicability()` to use FNN for nearest 
  neighbors, rather than fields. This sped up prediction by a _lot_.

## Bug Fixes

* Rewrote README and moved the old content to a new vignette on assessing the
  spatial dependency in model residuals.
  
* Added a dependency on FNN.

* Minimum version for dplyr has been bumped to 1.1.0

# waywiser 0.2.0

* Added functions for calculating the area of applicability of a model. 

# waywiser 0.1.0

* Added functions for automatically constructing `nb` and `listw` objects

* Added functions for global and local Geary's C values.

* Added functions for local Getis-Ord G and G* values.

* Added functions for global and local Moran's I values.

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
