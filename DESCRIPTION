Description: Assessing predictive models of spatial data can be challenging, 
    both because these models are typically built for extrapolating outside the
    original region represented by training data and due to potential spatially
    structured errors, with "hot spots" of higher than expected error
    clustered geographically due to spatial structure in the underlying
    data. These functions provide methods for measuring the spatial
    structure of model errors and evaluating where predictions can be made 
    safely, and are particularly useful for models fit using the 'tidymodels' 
    framework. Methods include Moran's I
    ('Moran' (1950) <doi:10.2307/2332142>), Geary's C 
    ('Geary' (1954) <doi:10.2307/2986645>), Getis-Ord's G
    ('Ord' and 'Getis' (1995) <doi:10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x>),
    as well as an implementation of the area of applicability methodology from
    'Meyer' and 'Pebesma' (2021) (<doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13650>).
