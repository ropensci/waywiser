Description: This package is an experimental fork of the 'waywiser'
    package, replacing slow calculations with implementations written in
    Rust. This package will not be released to CRAN, and there is
    currently no intention of the Rust rewrites making their way upstream
    to the original package; the maintenance burden that would involve
    outweighs the speed benefits.  There is also no promise that
    improvements in the upstream repo ever migrate to this package. As
    described in the original package, assessing predictive models of
    spatial data can be challenging, both because these models are
    typically built for extrapolating outside the original region
    represented by training data and due to potential spatially structured
    errors, with "hot spots" of higher than expected error clustered
    geographically due to spatial structure in the underlying data.
    Methods are provided for assessing models fit to spatial data,
    including approaches for measuring the spatial structure of model
    errors, assessing model predictions at multiple spatial scales, and
    evaluating where predictions can be made safely. Methods are
    particularly useful for models fit using the 'tidymodels' framework.
    Methods include Moran's I ('Moran' (1950) <doi:10.2307/2332142>),
    Geary's C ('Geary' (1954) <doi:10.2307/2986645>), Getis-Ord's G ('Ord'
    and 'Getis' (1995) <doi:10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x>),
    agreement coefficients from 'Ji' and Gallo (2006) (<doi:
    10.14358/PERS.72.7.823>), agreement metrics from 'Willmott' (1981)
    (<doi: 10.1080/02723646.1981.10642213>) and 'Willmott' 'et' 'al'.
    (2012) (<doi: 10.1002/joc.2419>), an implementation of the area of
    applicability methodology from 'Meyer' and 'Pebesma' (2021)
    (<doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13650>), and an implementation of multi-scale
    assessment as described in 'Riemann' 'et' 'al'. (2010)
