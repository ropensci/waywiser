Description: Assessing predictive models of spatial data can be challenging, 
    both because these models are typically built for extrapolating outside the
    original region represented by training data and due to potential spatially
    structured errors, with "hot spots" of higher than expected error
    clustered geographically due to spatial structure in the underlying
    data. Methods are provided for assessing models fit to spatial data, 
    including approaches for measuring the spatial structure of model errors,
    assessing model predictions at multiple spatial scales, and evaluating where 
    predictions can be made safely. Methods are particularly useful for models 
    fit using the 'tidymodels' framework. Methods include Moran's I
    ('Moran' (1950) <doi:10.2307/2332142>), Geary's C 
    ('Geary' (1954) <doi:10.2307/2986645>), Getis-Ord's G
    ('Ord' and 'Getis' (1995) <doi:10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x>),
    agreement coefficients from 'Ji' and Gallo (2006) 
    (<doi: 10.14358/PERS.72.7.823>), agreement metrics from 'Willmott' (1981)
    (<doi: 10.1080/02723646.1981.10642213>) and 'Willmott' 'et' 'al'. (2012)
    (<doi: 10.1002/joc.2419>), an implementation of the area of applicability 
    methodology from 'Meyer' and 'Pebesma' (2021) 
    (<doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13650>), and an implementation of
    multi-scale assessment as described in 'Riemann' 'et' 'al'. (2010)
