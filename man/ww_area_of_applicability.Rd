\usage{
ww_area_of_applicability(x, ...)

\method{ww_area_of_applicability}{data.frame}(x, validation = NULL, importance, ...)

\method{ww_area_of_applicability}{matrix}(x, validation = NULL, importance, ...)

\method{ww_area_of_applicability}{formula}(x, data, validation = NULL, importance, ...)

\method{ww_area_of_applicability}{recipe}(x, data, validation = NULL, importance, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either a data frame, matrix, formula
(specifying predictor terms on the right-hand side), or recipe
(from \code{\link[recipes:recipe]{recipes::recipe()}}.

If \code{x} is a recipe, it should be the same one used to pre-process the data
used in your model. If the recipe used to build the area of applicability
doesn't match the one used to build the model, the returned area of
applicability won't be correct.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\item{validation}{A data frame or matrix containing the data used to
validate your model. This should be the same data as used to calculate all
model accuracy metrics.

If this argument is \code{NULL}, then this function will use the training data
(from \code{x} or \code{data}) to calculate within-sample distances.
This may result in the area of applicability threshold being set too high,
with the result that too many points are classed as "inside" the area of
applicability.}

\item{importance}{Either:
\itemize{
\item A data.frame with two columns: \code{term}, containing the names of each
variable in the training and validation data, and \code{estimate}, containing
the (raw or scaled) feature importance for each variable.
\item An object of class \code{vi} with at least two columns, \code{Variable} and \code{Importance}.
}

All variables in the training data (\code{x} or \code{data}, depending on the context)
must have a matching importance estimate, and all terms with importance
estimates must be in the training data.}

\item{data}{When \code{x} is a recipe or formula, \code{data} must be the data frame
representing your "training" data.}
}
\value{
A \code{ww_area_of_applicability} object, which can be used with \code{\link[=predict]{predict()}}
to calculate the distance of new data to the original training data, and
determine if new data is within a model's area of applicability.
}
\description{
This function calculates the "area of applicability" of a model, as
introduced by Meyer and Pebesma (2021). While the initial paper introducing
this method focused on spatial models, there is nothing inherently spatial
about the method; it can be used with any type of data.
}
\details{
Predictions made on points "inside" the area of applicability should be as
accurate as predictions made on the data provided to \code{y} or \code{validation}.
That means that generally \code{y} or \code{validation} should be your final hold-out
set, or the assessment set of a cross-validation fold, so that predictions
on points inside the area of applicability are accurately described by your
reported model metrics.

This method assumes your model was fit using dummy variables in the place of
any non-numeric predictor, and that you have one importance score per
dummy variable. Having non-numeric predictors will cause this function to
fail.
